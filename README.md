# crypto_watchdoge

Since Crypto market is at boom, people are investing in it.
There are lots of big players in the game, but there're still features
that none of them give combined.

This project is especially made to keep track of dogecoin value,
by adding custom notifications.

Data providers might stop responding. But a new serializer and 
new scrapper / API can fix this issue.


-> Constants defined for ALLOWED_CURRENCIES

-> Fetch crypto datas from provider 

-> Serializer the markte data as per requirement

-> Add process triggers in CryptoUtils

Keeping this opensource!

Obviously you're free to use this and add features!
